This is a software modification ("mod") for the game "Unreal Tournament 2004" by Epic Games and Atari.

Therefore the following section from its End User License Agreement applies:

-----
 11. Editor and End user Mods.

UnrealEd is a really cool feature which allows you to modify the Software or to construct new variations for use with it. These modifications and variations can be both playable and non playable. UnrealEd is NOT shareware. You may not freely distribute it to any BBS, CD, floppy or any other media. You may not sell it or repackage it for sale.
 b. Using UnrealEd, you may create modifications or enhancements to the Software, including the construction of new levels (collectively referred to as “Mods”), subject to the following restrictions:
    i.   Your Mods must only work with the full, registered copy of the Software, not independently or with any other software.
    ii.  Your Mods must not contain modifications to any executable file(s).
    iii.
